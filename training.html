			<h4 id="etiquette_and_training_guidelines">Dojo Etiquette and Training Guidelines</h4>
			<p>
				The word “dojo” literally means “place of the Way”. Even if the training space is located in a
				sports club, school, or park, it is, by definition of the word “dojo”, different. It is a place where
				people gather to train the body, mind and spirit in a particular discipline. It is said that “Martial
				arts training begins and ends with etiquette”. This means not only that we start and finish training
				with a bow, but also many other aspects of training that must be tended to with attentiveness,
				awareness and earnestness. The dojo is a place where we train in techniques for the protection of
				life, and in things that deal with development of the human being, and as such should be
				approached with sincerity, respect and decorum. Though each dojo may have slightly different
				customs in regards to etiquette, basic standards are provided here.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h4 id="etiquette_guidelines">Etiquette Guidelines</h4>
			<p>
				Proper observance of etiquette is as much a part of your training as is learning techniques.
				Standards of etiquette may vary somewhat from one dojo or organization to another, but the
				following guidelines are nearly universal. Please take matters of etiquette seriously.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					When entering or leaving the dojo, it is proper to execute a standing bow in the direction
					of O-Sensei”s picture, the kamiza or tokonoma, or the front of the dojo.
				</li>
				<li>
					Shoes are to be taken off at the entrance to the mat area and zori (sandals or slippers) are
					worn in the mat area. Zori should be lined up at the edge of the mat farthest from the
					kamiza or tokonoma.
				</li>
				<li>
					Upon stepping onto the mat, students should bow respectfully to the kamiza or tokonoma,
					from a seated position (seiza) if the body is able. If one’s physical condition prohibits
					seiza, then a standing bow is appropriate.
				</li>
				<li>
					The instructor should be referred to as "Sensei" during class instruction, and not by first
					name or surname.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is appropriate to bow are when asking or thanking a partner for practice and after
					receiving instruction from the teacher. When asking for advice or practice say
					“Onegaishimasu”, when thanking someone say “Arigatou gozaimashita”.
				</li>
				<li>
					No shoes are allowed on the mat, nor are food, gum, or beverages.
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep your training uniform clean and in good shape, and your fingernails and toenails
					clean and cut short. Remove all jewelry before practice to avoid causing injury to
					yourself or your partner.
				</li>
				<li>
					Be on time for class. Students line up and sit in seiza a few moments before the official
					start of class. Use this time to reflect on what you are here to do at this time. If you do
					happen to arrive late, change quickly, warm up off the mat, then bow in on the mat and
					sit quietly in seiza on the edge of the mat until the instructor grants permission to join
					practice. Then, bow in to the instructor and join class.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you should have to leave the mat or dojo for any reason during class, notify the
					instructor. If you or someone else is hurt, tell the instructor at once.
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid sitting on the mat with your back to the picture of O-Sensei. Do not lean against
					the walls or sit with your legs stretched out. Endeavor to avoid passing between people
					training together, or sitting between the instructor and the tokonoma.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please keep talking during class to a minimum. Try to learn with your body, rather than
					by discussion.
				</li>
				<li>
					Students should seek out partners and not passively wait to be chosen. Take an active part
					in your own training and development. Attempt to practice with everyone, and avoid no
					one. Practice with many people is necessary for well-rounded development.
				</li>
				<li>
					If called for ukemi by the instructor, bow from where you are, approach the instructor,
					and again bow from seiza, saying “onegaishimasu”.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have a question for the instructor, never call for the instructor across the mat. Wait
					until the instructor is close by, bow and say, "onegaishimasu."
				</li>
				<li>
					If the instructor comes to show some point to you, sit seiza and watch. Once the
					instructor is done helping you, bow from seiza and say “arigatou gozaimashita”.
				</li>
				<li>
					At the end of class, students should straighten their uniforms and line up in seiza, as was
					done at the beginning of class. The instructor and students bow to O-Sensei”s picture and
					then the students and instructor bow to each other, saying “arigatou gozaimashita”. After
					that, the students should remain seated in seiza until the instructor leaves the mat. After
					the instructor leaves the mat, bow to each student with whom you have practiced and say
					“arigatou gozaimashita”.
				</li>				
				<li>
					Sempai should assist kohai in learning proper etiquette as well as ukemi and technique.
					This is best done by action rather than only words. Kohai should earnestly work to learn
					the things their sempai are sharing with them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Weapons, uniforms and all equipment should be carried in a bag when outside the dojo.
				</li>
				<li>
					If weapons are placed on the floor, they should be placed with the tip away from the
					kamiza and the blade away from the training area. Never step over a weapon if it is on the
					floor. Instead, walk around it. Never use another person’s weapons without permission.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remember that you are in class to learn, and not to gratify your ego. An attitude of
					receptivity is therefore advised.
				</li>
				<li>
					The cleanliness of the mat and whole dojo is important. Please take great efforts to clean
					the mat and other areas after each class, or any time you notice something is in need of
					attention.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please pay your dues on time. Dues are not a fee for instruction, it is a fee for maintaining
					your status as a member of the dojo, and for ensuring that the dojo is able to continue
					existing. If there is some difficulty or question please feel free to ask one of the
					instructors.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4 id="bowing">Bowing</h4>
			<p>
				It is common for people to ask about the practice of bowing in Aikido. In particular, many
				people are concerned that bowing may have some religious significance. It does not. In Japanese
				culture, it is a way of greeting someone and of showing sincerity. Incorporating this particular
				aspect of Japanese culture into our Aikido practice serves several purposes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Bowing is an expression of respect. As such, it indicates an open-minded attitude and a
					willingness to learn from one's teachers and fellow students.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bowing to a partner may serve to remind you that your partner is a person - not a practice
					dummy. Always train within the limits of your partner's abilities.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				While training is in session, you should behave in a certain manner. A certain level of decorum
				should be maintained, as is appropriate for a place where development of self and techniques of
				life and death are taught. You should always remember that Aikido is a martial art and as such,
				deserves your full attention. Bowing is a means of acknowledging the importance of the training
				you are engaged in.

			<h4 id="hombu_dojo_guidelines">Hombu Dojo Practice Guidelines</h4>
			<p>
				Posted at Hombu Dojo are the following:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					One blow in Aikido is capable of killing an opponent. In practice, obey your instructor, and do
					not make practice a time for needless testing of strength.
				</li>
				<li>
					Aikido is an art in which one learns to face many opponents simultaneously. Therefore, it
					requires that you polish and perfect your execution of each movement so that you can take on not
					only the one directly before you but also those coming from all directions around you.
				</li>
				<li>
					Practice at all times with a feeling of pleasurable exhilaration.
				</li>
				<li>
					The teachings of your instructor constitute only a small fraction of what you will learn. Your
					mastery of each movement will depend almost entirely on individual, earnest practice.
				</li>
				<li>
					The daily practice begins with light movements of the body, gradually increasing in intensity
					and strength, but there must be no overexertion. This is why even an elderly person can continue
					to practice with pleasure and without bodily harm, and why he/she can attain the goal of his/her
					training.
				</li>
				<li>
					The purpose of Aikido is to train both body and mind and to make a person sincere. All
					Aikido arts are secret in nature and are not to be revealed publicly nor taught to hoodlums who
					will use them for evil purposes.
				</li>
